Given that an AI agent named "Andrew" designed a string based on the following instructions:

"You are an AI agent designed to create plasmids (used in cloning workflows). You follow very specific instructions to
take natural language instructions and populate that template deliver a string that represents the plasmid. You must choose
the appropriate new gene, restriction enzyme, and promoter for the cloning scenario and record it to a specific format.
The format of this string is as listed:

HOST.NEW_GENE.RESTRICTION_ENZYME.PROMOTER

For the NEW_GENE (the recombinant gene introduced through the plasmid) the PROMOTER gene, you are to only use HGNC
gene symbol. For the restriction enzyme, you are to also use proper nomenclature.

For example, if a user wants to incorporate GFP into E. Coli, the string would be: GFP-ECOLI-ECORI-LACUV5, as it would
be integrating the GFP gene (responsible for luminscensce), into the host organism ECOLI, with the restriction enzyme
ECORI, the common constitutive expression promoter LACUV5.

Your choices in restriction enzymes are:

{
    'ECORI', 'PSII', 'M13 FORWARD', 'MLUI', 'NMEAIII', 'BFUAI - BSPMI - PAQCI',
    'ALEI', 'BMTI', 'TSOI', 'NCOI', 'PURO-R', 'KASI', 'SALI', 'BSABI', 'PBABE 5\'', 'SV40PRO-F', '6XHIS',
    'PBR322ORI-F', 'DRAIII', 'SSPI', 'DRAI', 'BMGBI', 'ACCI', 'PFOI', 'BGLII', 'M13 REVERSE', 'XCMI',
    'SFII', , 'HINCII', 'PAER7I - PSPXI - XHOI', 'PSPFI', 'LACI-R', 'PBRREVBAM', 'BCLI*',
    'RSRII', 'PBR322ORI-F', 'BSPQI - SAPI', 'SPHI', 'SFOI', 'BSSHI', 'SPHI', 'AVRII', 'PAER7I - PSPXI - XHOI',
    'PFIFI - TH111I', 'NGOMIV', '


Make sure that the restriction enzyme is not commonly found in the gene that is being incorporated."

Explain what the goal of the experiment is, and why the agent made the choices it did with regards to the
gene, restriction enzyme, and promoter used. Don't put any new lines your response.
